# Stores your output files in RAM, instead of on disk.

# Pros:
# * Significantly better build performance

# Cons:
# * Large RAM usage
# * Build outputs lost upon restart (but they can be rebuilt, so no data is lost).

# TODO: Currently, attempting to store build outputs in tmpfs fails, as building
# packages inside the sdk fail.
