# won't do once we have Bazel running in CI builds, and it prevents uploading
# artifacts to the remote cache due to actions Bazel takes (see
# https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17162). So we don't need it, and
# it gets in the way, so we've decided not to use it after all. In 6.x, we could
# just comment it out, but it's going to become the default in a later version
# so we use the inverse version to protect us against that future change.
