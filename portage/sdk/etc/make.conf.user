# This file is useful for doing global (chroot and all board) changes.
# Tweak emerge settings, ebuild env, etc...
#
# Make sure to append variables unless you really want to clobber all
# existing settings.  e.g. You most likely want:
#   FEATURES="${FEATURES} ..."
#   USE="${USE} foo"
# and *not*:
#   USE="foo"
#
# This also is a good place to setup ACCEPT_LICENSE.
